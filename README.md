# csrookie
This github repository aims to record my studying path in cs. My personal website is here: [csrookie](https://bearthesilly.github.io)

I have just finished the internship in [4DVLab](https://4dvlab.github.io/index.html) on the work of AAAI 2025 (Aug 20th), proudly under the instruction and guidance of [Prof.Yuexin Ma](https://yuexinma.me/aboutme.html) and senior [Yiteng Xu](https://yiteng-xu.github.io/). And I am currently looking for the next internship. 

My research interest is currently about Computer Vision (Point Cloud), Computer Graphics (Neural Radiance Field), and Natural Language Processing. I am still struggling to discover my real interest to focus on. I am also a little bit interested into the interpretability in Deep Learning. 

In this repository, I will share as much resource as possible, including the slides, homework(if allowed to), and note, etc. Particularly, I will record my path of studying and researching in the field of deep learning.  

I'm currently a student studying computer science in Shanghaitech University, Sophomore. I name my github repository 'csrookie' for, literally, I'm still a rookie in the field of cs.
